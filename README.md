# Stock Market Forecasting Web App

This project is a stock market forecasting application built using an LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) model. The app predicts future stock prices based on historical data and provides an interactive interface using Streamlit.

## Features

- Forecasts future stock prices using an LSTM model.
- Interactive web interface built with Streamlit.
- Visualizes historical and forecasted stock prices.
- Easy to configure and deploy locally.

## Requirements

- Python 3.7+
- TensorFlow (for LSTM model)
- Streamlit
- Other dependencies listed in `requirements.txt`

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-repo/stock-market-forecasting.git
    cd stock-market-forecasting
    ```

2. **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

3. **Add the LSTM model file:**
    Ensure the LSTM model file `Latest_stock_price_model.keras` is in the project directory.

4. **Run the Streamlit web app:**
    Start the web app by executing:
    ```bash
    streamlit run app.py
    ```

## Usage

Open your web browser and navigate to `http://localhost:8501`. Use the app interface to input historical stock data and get predictions for future stock prices.

## Customization

You can customize the forecasting model or the app interface by editing the following files:
- `app.py`: Main Streamlit app script.
- `model.py`: Script for loading and using the LSTM model (if applicable).
- `requirements.txt`: Add or update dependencies as needed.

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter any issues:
- Verify that all dependencies are installed correctly.
- Ensure the LSTM model file is correctly placed in the project directory.
- Check for errors in the model loading or data processing steps.
